[webtorrent/webtorrent: ⚡️ Streaming torrent client for the web](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent)

> To make BitTorrent work over WebRTC (which is the only P2P transport that works on the web) we made some protocol changes. Therefore, a browser-based WebTorrent client or "web peer" can only connect to other clients that support WebTorrent/WebRTC.
>
> To seed files to web peers, use a client that supports WebTorrent, e.g. [WebTorrent Desktop](https://webtorrent.io/desktop), a desktop client with a familiar UI that can connect to web peers, [webtorrent-hybrid](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent-hybrid), a command line program, or [Instant.io](https://instant.io/), a website. Established torrent clients like **Vuze** have [already added WebTorrent support](https://wiki.vuze.com/w/WebTorrent) so they can connect to both normal *and* web peers. We hope other clients will follow.

> P2P connections over the web are usually not possible due to typical consumer router configurations and bad decisions in the design of WebRTC protocol. The vast majority of these P2P web projects, including WebTorrent, is actually using proxy servers to fake the illusion of P2P connectivity (to be specific, they are using TURN servers to proxy traffic).
