  #quote[Until version 4.5.0, qBittorrent had a native search engine based on Python. qBittorrent team was in charge of checking the installation of Python and the maintenance of the search plugins for the torrent sites. There were also unofficial plugins maintained by the community.
  
  Over the time, maintaining this system has become a burden due to the large number of torrent sites and the lack of developers with knowledge of Python. Since version 4.5.0 the native search engine is replaced with a new search engine that makes calls to #a[Torznab compatible APIs][https://torznab.github.io/spec-1.3-draft/torznab/Specification-v1.3.html]. This implies that the end user has to install additional software to perform searches in qBittorrent.
