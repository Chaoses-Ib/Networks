In computer systems, *name resolution* refers to the retrieval of the underlying numeric values corresponding to computer hostnames, account user names, group names, and other named entities.

In computer networking, it refers to processes used to obtain the assigned IP addresses needed to communicate with devices whose host or domain names are known. Examples include the Domain Name System (DNS), Network Information Service and Multicast DNS (mDNS). IP addresses for devices on the local segment can in turn be resolved to MAC addresses by invoking the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
