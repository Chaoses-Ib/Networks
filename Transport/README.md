## System integration
TCP 的硬件和系统集成使得它能够被更好地优化，但反过来也更容易被审查，降低了可靠性。

## Libraries
### C++
- [Boost.Asio](https://github.com/boostorg/asio)
  - `acceptor::async_accept()` will *silently fail* if the port is already in use. Only `acceptor::bind()` will throw an exception.

  > This is too bizarre a thing to want to do for a standard library to provide functions for it. I expect you'd have to use a low level system-specific API to achieve this.
